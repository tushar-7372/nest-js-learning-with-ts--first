## general

- in this project , we have set up the project manually ( without using nest cli )
and learned about the basic requirements of nest js project
- here we create the project ourself â€” installing dependencies, creating folders, and wiring everything manually.

- to run this locally :
> npx ts-node-dev src/main.ts

- creating a controller via command :
> nest generate controller messages/messages --flat
